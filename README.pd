## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes wants to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Technologies Used
- statsmodel 
- sci kit learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Conclusions
- The three main variables on which the demand of the shared bike depends based on the data are
- Temperature : This variable is positively correlating with the predicting variable.
- Humidity : This variable is negatively correlating with the demand of shared bike.
- Year :  This variable is positively correlating with the demand for shared bike.
